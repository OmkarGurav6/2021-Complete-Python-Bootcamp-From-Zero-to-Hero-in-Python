
For working with images, use Pillow library which is fork of PIL(Python Imaging Library).

When working with images in the jupyter notebook, you may get the following warning:

IOPub data rate exceeded.
The notebook server will temporarily stop sending output
to the client in order to avoid crashing it.
To change this limit, set the config variable
`--NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit`.

If you get this warning, try stopping the notebook at the command line, then restarting it with:

jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit=1.0e10

Basically this adds a "flag" that the limit should be raised during this session of jupyter notebook that you are running.

Only for jupyter notebook mac(objectname) will show image, use mac.show() for other IDEs. 

The crop() method returns a rectangular region from this image. 
The box is a 4-tuple defining the left, upper, right, and lower pixel coordinate.

All the coordinates of box (x, y, w, h) are measured from the top left corner of the image.
In short coordinates are start of image x, start of image y, end of image x, end of image y.

Note this is not permanent change
for permanent change, do a reassignment
e.g. nlp = nlp.resize((100,100))

You can rotate images by specifying the amount of degrees to rotate on the rotate() method. 
The original dimensions will be kept and "filled" in with black. 
You can optionally pass in the expand parameter to fill the new rotated image to the old dimensions.

We can add an alpha value (RGBA stands for RED,Green,Blue, Alpha) where values can go from 0 to 255.
If Alpha is 0 the image is completely transparent, if it is 255 then its completely opaque.
We can adjust image alpha values with the putalpha() method.
